The Game
-----------------------------
A bowling game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player is allowed up to two rolls to knock down 10 pins. Depending on the number of pins knocked down and the number of rolls required there are three different outcomes:
- An open frame is a frame where the player knocked down less than ten pins. The score is equal to the number of pins knocked down.
- A spare is a frame where the player finishes the second roll with all pins knocked down. The score of the spare is 10 plus the pins knocked down with the player’s next throw.
- A strike is a frame where the player knocks down all 10 pins with the first roll. The score is 10 plus the player’s next two rolls.
